# style-classification-app

A simple app that prepares the data, trains it on a custom model and lets users classify art style of a painting. Includes a simple dashboard that allows the user to send images of a painting and classify the art style.

Object Oriented Programming paradigm was used and I tried to incorporate some of the best software engineering practices into the project, while experiments were run in Jupyter notebooks.

## Running the app

To run the project with just the dashboard and classification capabilities, pull the Docker image: 

`docker pull wozniakmik/painting-classification`,

run `dash_app.py` and open the IP address shown in the console.


The project is also deployed on AWS, but due to cost saving, it's currently turned off. Contact me if You wish to receive a link.
